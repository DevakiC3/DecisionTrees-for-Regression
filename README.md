Decision Trees to forecast Concrete Compressive Strength
The aim of this predictive analysis is to use the machine learning model - Decision Trees to forecast Concrete Compressive Strenght based on 8 explanatory variables.
I will be creating a decision tree model and evaluating the performance of the model through this project.
